# RemoteREPL.jl

`RemoteREPL` allows you to connect your local julia REPL to a separate Julia
process and run commands interactively:

* Run code in the `Main` module of a remote Julia process
* Standard REPL tab completion and help mode with `?`
* Transfer variables between processes with `%get` and `%put`
* Automatic ssh tunnel for network security. Reconnects dropped connections.
