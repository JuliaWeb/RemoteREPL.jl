# How-To

## Serve a REPL from a remote server

1. Run an ssh server on `your.example.host` and perform the usual ssh setup.
   (For example, add your public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server.)
2. Your Julia server should call `serve_repl()`. Use `@async serve_repl()` if
   you'd like to run other server tasks concurrently.

## Connect to a REPL on a remote server

1. Set up passwordless ssh to your server. Usually this means you have
   `ssh-agent` running with your private key loaded. If you've got some
   particular ssh options needed for the server, you'll find it convenient to
   set these up in the OpenSSH config file (`~/.ssh/config` on unix). For
   example,
   ```ssh-config
   Host your.example.host
      User ubuntu
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/some_identity
   ```
2. Start up Julia and run the code
   ```julia
   using RemoteREPL; connect_repl("your.example.host")
   ```
   Alternatively use the shell wrapper script `RemoteREPL/bin/julia-r`:
   ```bash
   julia-r your.example.host
   ```


## Plot variables from the server

The [`@remote`](@ref) macro can be used to get variables from the server and
plot them on the client with a single line of code. For example:

```julia
remote> x = 1:42; y = x.^2;

julia> plot(@remote((x,y))...)
```


## Use alternatives to SSH

### AWS Session Manager

You can use [AWS Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html) instead of SSH to connect to remote hosts. To do this, first setup Session Manager for the EC2 instances you like. See the [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-getting-started.html). Thereafter, install [AWS CLI version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) and then install the [Session Manager plugin for AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html) on your local system.

Setup your AWS CLI by running `aws configure` on the command line. You can then connect to the RemoteREPL server on your EC2 instance with `connect_repl("your-instance-id"; tunnel=:aws, region="your-instance-region")`. The `region` argument is only required if the EC2 instance is not in the default region that your CLI was setup with.

### Kubernetes `kubectl`

If [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) is configured on your local system, you can use that to connect to RemoteREPL servers on your Kubernetes cluster. Run the following snippet: `connect_repl("your-pod-name"; tunnel=:k8s, namespace="your-namespace")`. The `namespace` argument is only required if the Pod is not in the default Kubernetes namespace.
